# Planetary Loop Machine
for all your Intergalactic missions - loop samples and explore new worlds

## Status -> building

Next little project I wanted to explore something with sound. So decided to use the mini_audio API and build a sample looping program. Simple console UI with the idea of live proformance looping.

Currently all sample are required to be the same BPM. Transitions can be set to be made at any interval of bar of your choice.

#### To Come
- Multi-engine allowing you to listen to sample on another output before launching
- effects
- better UI layout and commands
